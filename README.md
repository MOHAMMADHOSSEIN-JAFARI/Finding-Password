# Finding Password
In this project you need to implement a task. The file sample source.py you need to use for submites is at the bottom of the page (file download option) click on this option to download the file.

Note that the codes are from 1000 to 9999.

Do not change the name of the function in any way and implement all the codes you want to hit in the same def (do not code outside def) and complete the task function of the corresponding function, and then make sure to remove this file with the name (source.py) and be sure to zip (rar not just zip) and send. (In the zip file, only one file should be the same as the source.py and do not include any other files in the zip file)

If you do not comply with any of the above points, unfortunately your score will be zeroed by the system.

Note: The online arbitration system uses Python 3.4, in this version dictionaries do not remember the order of data entry to themselves and may not achieve the desired result if they are sorted, use OrderedDict to fix this problem instead of dict, this data structure can be imported from the collections library in the app.
